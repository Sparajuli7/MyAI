## Quick Setup

### Prerequisites
1. **Flutter SDK**: Download from https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2. **Ollama**: For local LLM support
   ```bash
   # Windows
   iwr -useb https://ollama.ai/install.ps1 | iex
   
   # Mac/Linux
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
   ```
3. **LLM Model**: Pull recommended model
   ```bash
   ollama pull gemma3:270m
   ```

### Installation
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd myai_ux
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d chrome --web-port 8080
   ```

4. Access at: `http://localhost:8080`

### Platform Support
- **iOS**: `flutter run -d ios`
- **Android**: `flutter run -d android`
- **Web**: `flutter run -d chrome`
- **Desktop**: `flutter run -d macos` (macOS) or `flutter run -d windows` (Windows)

## Usage

### Knowledge Graph Interface
1. **Graph View**: Interactive node-link visualization of your data
2. **Node Selection**: Click nodes to select them (white ring appears)
3. **Multi-Selection**: Select multiple documents for AI analysis
4. **Info Panel**: View selected documents in bottom-left panel
5. **Theme Selector**: Switch between Dark, Light, and Nepal Sunset themes

### AI Assistant
1. **Activate AI Panel**: Click the brain/psychology icon to open
2. **Document Context**: AI has access to selected documents
3. **Natural Queries**: Ask questions about your data in plain language
4. **Streaming Responses**: Watch AI responses appear in real-time
5. **Chat History**: Previous conversations are preserved

### Example Queries
With demo data selected, try:
- "What is my visa status?"
- "Summarize the meeting notes"
- "When do I need to renew my documents?"
- "What are the key topics in these documents?"

### Graph Navigation
1. **Pan**: Click and drag to move around the graph
2. **Zoom**: Use mouse wheel to zoom in/out (future feature)
3. **Node Types**: Different colors represent different data types
4. **Connections**: Lines show relationships between documents

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- `provider`: State management for reactive UI
- `uuid`: Unique data identifiers
- `http`: HTTP client for Ollama API communication
- `file_picker`: File upload simulation
- `flutter/gestures`: Touch and pointer event handling

### Architecture
- **State Management**: Provider pattern for reactive UI updates
- **Data Models**: `DataItem` and `Orb` classes for data representation
- **Animations**: Custom animation controllers for smooth transitions
- **Theming**: Dynamic theme system with color schemes

### Simulated Features
